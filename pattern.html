CBSE does not publish any official “prediction” or exact frequency table of questions. Publicly available data include past papers, the official sample paper and marking scheme, the official Competency‑Focused Practice Questions, and blueprints / weightage tables from CBSE and major publishers.<br>
From these, clear patterns emerge, but exact “frequency counts” and “probability percentages” for each derivation or question are **not** officially available. Any such numbers in coaching material are private estimates, not CBSE data.  <br>
<br>
So the answer below is a *trend‑based, evidence‑backed prediction*, not a guarantee. Where other sources quote specific years (e.g., “asked in 2019, 2021, 2023”), those are cited; otherwise, probabilities are expressed qualitatively (Very High / High / Medium / Low) rather than fake percentages.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
## STEP 1 – Data & Pattern Overview (What the evidence shows)<br>
<br>
Key sources used:<br>
<br>
- **Official CBSE Class 12 Physics SQP 2025‑26 + Marking Scheme** (Code 042) – pattern, typology, chapter spread.<br>

- **CBSE “Additional Practice Questions” and CFPQ summaries** via SelfStudys, NDTV, etc.<br>

- **Major publishers’ blueprints & question banks** – Oswal, Arihant, Together With, XamIdea, question‑bank portals.<br>
<br>
**Stable exam design (as per CBSE & major guides):**<br>
<br>

- 33 questions:  <br>
  - Section A: 16 × 1‑mark (12 MCQ + 4 Assertion‑Reason)<br>
  - Section B: 5 × 2 marks  <br>
  - Section C: 7 × 3 marks  <br>
  - Section D: 2 × 4‑mark case‑based  <br>
  - Section E: 3 × 5‑mark long answer  <br>
- Chapter‑wise weightage (theory) – consistent across official SQP and major publishers:<br>
<br>
  - Unit I: Electrostatics (Ch 1–2) + Unit II: Current Electricity (Ch 3) → about **16 marks**  <br>
  - Unit III: Magnetic Effects of Current & Magnetism (Ch 4–5) + Unit IV: EMI & AC (Ch 6–7) → about **17 marks**  <br>
  - Unit V: EM Waves (Ch 8) + Unit VI: Optics (Ch 9–10) → about **18 marks**  <br>

***<br>
<br>
## STEP 3 – CBSE Trend Analysis (Which chapters dominate, rotate, were strong/weak in 2025)<br>
<br>
### Chapters consistently favored every year<br>
<br>
From official weightage tables (Oswal, LearnCBSE, Shiksha, PW, etc.) and analysis of 2015–2025 papers, the *core* units that always carry substantial marks are:<br>
<br>
- **Electrostatics + Current Electricity (Units I & II)** – combined ~16 marks.  <br>
- **Magnetism + EMI + AC (Units III & IV)** – combined ~17 marks.  <br>
- **Optics (Unit VI)** – about 14 marks within an 18‑mark block with EM waves.  <br>
- **Modern Physics (Dual Nature, Atoms, Nuclei) (Units VII & VIII)** – about 12 marks.  <br>
- **Semiconductor Devices (Unit IX)** – ~7 marks.<br>
<br>
These units *dominate the conceptual and numerical load* of the paper.<br>
<br>
### Chapters “rotated” mainly in style, not in presence<br>
<br>
- **Electromagnetic Waves (Ch 8)**: Often appears as 1‑mark MCQ/AR + sometimes 2‑mark conceptual; rarely long numericals.  <br>
- **Magnetism & Matter (Ch 5)**: Some years mostly theory (properties of materials, earth’s field), other years appears inside numericals (magnetic dipole, BH curve).  <br>
- **Wave Optics (Ch 10)**: Sometimes gets full 3–5 mark derivation (YDSI/diffraction), other years more MCQ/short conceptual.<br>
<br>
So, almost *every* chapter appears every year; what rotates is whether it gets a heavy derivation/numerical versus small MCQs/shorts.<br>
<br>
### What 2025 board paper emphasized<br>
<br>
From 2025 analysis and PYQ pages:<br>
<br>
- **High emphasis:**  <br>
  - Electrostatics & Current Electricity – conceptual + numericals.  <br>
  - Magnetism & EMI/AC – several tricky numericals and reasoning.  <br>
  - **Optics** – including ray optics derivation (lens maker / lens formula) and instruments.  <br>
  - **Modern Physics (Dual Nature + Atoms + Nuclei)** – derivation/numerical combo; photoelectric effect and nuclear Qs.<br>
<br>
- **EM Waves and basic theory topics** appeared largely as direct MCQs and short conceptual questions – comparatively “easy scoring”.<br>
<br>
### Likely shifts for 2026 (based on blueprint + sample paper + 2026 derivation lists)<br>
<br>
- The **official 2025‑26 SQP** already locks in:  <br>
  - A **big 5‑mark derivation in Optics** (Lens maker) AND  <br>
  - A **5‑mark electromagnetism or EMI/AC derivation** (transformer / galvanometer conversion) AND  <br>
  - A **5‑mark Electrostatics/Capacitance derivation**.<br>
<br>
- Coaching analyses and articles for “top derivations 2026” emphasize **exactly the same cluster**: Gauss law & dipole fields, capacitor with dielectric, Ohm’s law from drift, force between parallel wires, lens maker, prism deviation, Bohr model, Einstein PE equation, rectifiers.<br>
<br>
Given CBSE’s policy of keeping the *assessment scheme unchanged* for 2025‑26 and the official sample reflecting the internal blueprint, it is highly likely that **Electrostatics, Circuits, Magnetism/EMI/AC, Optics, and Modern Physics will again dominate 2026.**<br>
<br>

***<br>
<br>
## STEP 11 – Student Priority Strategy (If time is limited)<br>
<br>
Organize your revision like an exam‑setter, not just a student.<br>
<br>
### Priority 1 – Must Do (Core, concept + derivations + numericals) – target 90–100% from these<br>
<br>
- **Electrostatics & Capacitance (Ch 1–2) – entire derivation & numerical cluster.**  <br>
- **Current Electricity (Ch 3) – drift/Ohm’s law, circuits, internal resistance.**  <br>
- **Magnetism + EMI + AC (Ch 4–7)** – especially force between wires, solenoid field, Faraday/Lenz, induced emf problems, LCR basics, transformer.  <br>
- **Optics (Ch 9–10)** – lens maker, lens formula, instruments, interference/diffraction explanations.  <br>
- **Modern Physics & Semiconductors (Ch 11–14)** – PE effect, Bohr, nuclei energy, rectifiers & diodes.<br>
<br>
Action:  <br>
- Finish all NCERT examples and back‑of‑chapter exercises.  <br>
- Solve official SQP 2025‑26 + marking scheme fully.<br>
- Solve at least 3 good sample papers from major publishers (Oswal, Arihant, Educart).<br>
<br>
### Priority 2 – Very Important (Mainly theory + short derivations)<br>
<br>
- EM Waves (Ch 8): spectrum, uses, qualitative Qs.  <br>
- Magnetism & Matter (part of Ch 5): earth’s field, magnetic properties.  <br>
- Wave Optics (Ch 10): conceptual MCQs, intensity patterns.<br>
<br>
Action:  <br>
- Focus on 1‑ and 2‑mark theory and graph questions; write crisp answers.  <br>
<br>
### Priority 3 – Important but lower weight per topic<br>
<br>
- Fine details of magnetism (hysteresis loop, B–H curve)  <br>
- Some lesser‑used semiconductor configurations (transistor amplifier details, if included).  <br>
<br>
Action:  <br>
- Cover from one *good* notes source or question bank; don’t over‑invest time unless targeting near‑perfect 70/70.<br>
<br>
### Priority 4 – Less Important / can be skimmed late<br>
<br>
No chapter is “skippable” in the current competency‑based pattern, but within each chapter:<br>
<br>
- Rare edge cases, long textual derivations not in standard lists.  <br>
- Very specialized communication‑system type content if removed from current syllabus (check latest CBSE syllabus PDF).<br>
<br>
***<br>

### How to use this prediction to aim for 95%+<br>
<br>
1. **Treat Priority‑1 + Priority‑2 topics as non‑negotiable.** Finish NCERT + Exemplar + official CFPQ questions for them.<br>
2. **Drill the canonical derivations** listed above until they can be written perfectly within time.  <br>
3. **Solve the official SQP + marking scheme like a real exam**; then 3–5 quality sample papers from Oswal/Arihant/Educart/XamIdea to master pattern and presentation.<br>
4. **Use competency‑based booklets** to build case‑study and application‑based strength, especially in capacitors, circuits, transformers, optics, semiconductors, and photoelectric effect.<br>
<br>
If you wish, a follow‑up can focus on a **chapter‑wise micro‑plan** (exact derivations to memorize, which numerical models to practice, and how to write answers for full marks in each section).
